    "# An Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using Jupyter Notebooks for our workshop. We will create and edit notebooks from https://notebooks.azure.com, so no additional software will be required during this class. If you have a browser and an account on Azure Notebooks, you're ready to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "A notebook allows us to combine interactive code blocks and rich text elements and media in a single, online document. Because notebooks are both machine readable and human readable, they have quickly become a favorite form of sharing scientific, financial, statistical or computational reports. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/brianckeegan/Bechdel/blob/master/Bechdel_test.ipynb is a notebook for addressing *The Need for Openness in Data Journalism*. You can see how the author integrates the primary text message with code processing the data to justify the author's conclusions.\n"
